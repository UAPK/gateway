## How It Works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[Your AI Agent] -->|1. Propose Action| G[UAPK Gateway]
  G -->|2. Check Policy| P[Policy Engine]
  P -->|3a. ALLOW| T[Execute via Connector]
  P -->|3b. DENY| A
  P -->|3c. ESCALATE| H[Human Approver]
  H -->|Approve| T
  H -->|Deny| A
  T -->|4. Log| L[(Tamper-Evident Audit Log)]
```

**Key principle:** Agents don't have direct access to tools. They propose actions to the gateway, which enforces policy and logs everything.
